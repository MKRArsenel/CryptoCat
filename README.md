# CryptoCat
Discord bot coded in Python:
- This bot does not use the "/" functionality of discord v13.d because it must be coded in JavaScript to do so.
- The functionalities are in their initial phase since I am documenting both the language and the methods that Discord uses for events.
- This bot does not have any license so use it to your liking.
